## What is wement.io ?

wement.io is a website provide a professional comment plugin for developer`s personal blog site, include data storage service, earnings service, open api, comment themes, access statistics, friend links and so on.

## Reason to develop this website

Why you write blogs to CSDN, cnblogs others blog systems you can not have any earning back ? Why your link of blogs are shared by you or others to 开发者头条, but you have nothing back, it is very unfair, Nowadays more and more developers like build there own personal blog site, but few of them have comment system, and they can hardly get pay back to the blog, so I think to build wement.io to ensure the comment service and earnings. may be you agree with me, and want to take part in our projection, please contact me with any of communication ways:
